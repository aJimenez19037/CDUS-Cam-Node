#CDUS-Cam-Node
This repository containerizes OpenCV, ROS Melodic, Eigen, Realsense, and the PX4 Autopilot flight code. Through this repo you should be able to simulate in Gazebo a drone flying using the PX4 flight stack and the flight code. Additionally you should be able to run the low-SWAP code for the drone.
